### Challenge

To predict whether a company is worth given money to a Neural Network has been used:
with 41 neurons as input (i.e the number of features contained in the data) and 123 neurons in the hidden layer (using the Thumb rule).
Although the target model performance of 75% percent has not been met as the accuracy of the computed model has achieve a maximum of 73% with relu activation function and in only 50 epochs, several other modelling have been ruled out on the attempt to increase performance.
Many different epochs have been tried for the same initial activation function (up to 500) with no much difference.
Different activation functions also return similar results.
Finally a deep learning model has been build with two layer but it even decreased the overall performance.
Also, an attempt to remove some columns from the imput features has been tried but still it did not improve.

As the best result was achieved by a neural network of one hidden layer in 50 epochs, the Logistic Regression model could be a good candidate to be implemented in order to optimize the results as the output of both logistic Regression and Basic Neural Networks have similar performance.
